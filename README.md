# Comparison: Old Dashboard vs New Dashboard for Complex Reporting

## Old Dashboard (Custom Coding) üë®‚Äçüíª

**Description:** Tailored development using modern frameworks and libraries.

### Advantages:
- Full control over UI and functionality
- Highly customizable to meet specific requirements
- Scalable for complex, data-intensive applications
- Leverages powerful libraries for advanced features

### Limitations:
- Requires skilled developers
- May have longer initial development time
- Ongoing maintenance needed

**Suitability for Complex Reporting Dashboards:** 95% effectiveness

## New Dashboard (Low-Code Platform) üß©

**Description:** Visual development using pre-built components with some customization.

### Advantages:
- Rapid initial prototyping
- Accessible to non-developers
- Quick setup for standard features

### Limitations:
- Limited flexibility for complex UI/UX requirements
- Potential performance issues with data-intensive applications
- Difficulty in implementing highly specific or advanced features
- Possible limitations in scalability for complex projects

**Suitability for Complex Reporting Dashboards:** 30% effectiveness

## Key Considerations for Complex Reporting Dashboards

- Custom coding excels in projects requiring high customization and complex functionality.
- Low-code tools may struggle with sophisticated reporting dashboards and custom UI elements.
- For data-intensive applications, custom coding often offers better performance and scalability.
- The choice between custom and low-code depends on specific project requirements and long-term goals.

## Real-World Case Study: Dashboard Migration Attempt

### Timeline:
- **Month 0:** Decision to migrate to a low-code platform dashboard
- **Month 1:** Expected completion of migration (not achieved)
- **Month 7:** Basic functionality still not implemented in low-code version
- **Present:** Original custom-coded dashboard still in use, connecting to new database

**Key Takeaway:** In this specific case, the migration to a low-code platform took significantly longer than anticipated and struggled to replicate the functionality of the custom-coded solution. This highlights the potential challenges in using low-code platforms for complex, highly customized reporting dashboards.

## Learn More: Custom Coding vs No-code Solutions

The video discusses the pitfalls of no-code app development platforms, focusing on the speaker's personal experience with FlutterFlow. The main argument is that these platforms are a "trap" because:

- They often can't handle complex or unique features, limiting customization.
- The generated code is often messy and difficult to work with.
- They market themselves as full-stack solutions but fall short for production-grade applications.

### Key points:
- No-code platforms like FlutterFlow and Bubble work well for simple apps or MVPs.
- They struggle with the last 10-20% of development, especially for unique features.
- Downloading and working with the generated code can be challenging.
- Many developers recommend building apps "the old-fashioned way" for better results.
- No-code platforms can be useful for quick prototypes but may not be suitable for full-scale, production-ready applications.
